Assign variables:
A variable can be assigned the value of another variable.

let name1 = 'Olga';
let name2 = name1;
name1 = 'Clara';

In the second line, name2 is assigned the value of name1. The variable name2 gets the value 'Olga'. This value is retained by name2, even if name1 receives a new value afterwards.

Exercise:
Which value does x have after execution of the following code?
let x = 'Laurel';
let y = 'Hardy';
let z = y;
y = x;
x = z;

- Solution
'Hardy'
