Logging and Strings
Now we want to practice logging together with string concatenation.
Exercise
Write a function shout that takes a string and returns this string duplicated. In addition, the return should be logged.

Example: shout('Fire') should return 'FireFire' and should log 'FireFire'.
- Hint
function shout(word) {
  let result = word + word;
  ...
}
