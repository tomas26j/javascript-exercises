Multiple functions:

Now we define more then one function. As a reminder: A function with name color returning the value 'red' is defined as followed:

function color() {
  return 'red';
}

Exercise:
Define two functions. The first function a should return 'Hello a!' and the second function b should return 'Hello b!'.
