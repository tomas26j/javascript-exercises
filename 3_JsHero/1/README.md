Variables
JavaScript programs consist of a series of statements. Each statement performs an elementary operation. By executing many instructions you can finally solve complex tasks. Each statement is written in a line and closed with a semicolon.

An elementary statement is the declaration and initialization of a variable. A variable is a container for a value. The statement
let city = 'Porbandar';
declares a variable with the name city and initializes it with the value 'Porbandar'. The variable is declared with the keyword let. Use the equals sign, the assignment operator, to assign a value to the variable. Note: JavaScript is case-sensitive. city and City are two different variables.
Exercise
Declare a variable firstname and initialize it with the value 'Lata'.


>hint: ! let firstname = ...

>solution: ! let firstname = 'Lata';
